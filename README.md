# FuckElonMusk
A twitter bot that tells elon musk to go fuck himself in free speech. written in node.

# Why did i put this on github.
bc inevitably the bot will be blocked/suspended so i thought might as well make the code easy for others to replicate. no harm in that.

# how to setup
1. install node
2. sign up for a twitter application and get elevated permissions. save credentials.
3. `npm init` in a blank repository
4. `npm install --save twit` in working repository
5. put credentials from step 2 in `config.js`
